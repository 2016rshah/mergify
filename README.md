##[Mergify!](http://mergify.rshah.io/)

Merging spotify playlists on mobile ~~is~~ was impossible. I created Mergify at HackRU in 24 hours in an effort to solve the age-old perdicament. Mergify leverages Spotifiy's API to allow users to easily merge two of their playlists.

####Why?
Why is merging playlists so important you might ask. I used to organize all my playlists by artist. With that method if I knew what artist I was in the mood for all would be well. However, I wanted to be able to listen to multiple artists in one without ruining the freedom of having one artist playlists. I wanted an easy solution to create temporary playlists with songs from multiple artists easily. With this app now however I have started merging other playlists. For example I have multiple running playlists with different kinds of music (call me crazy) and I listen on mobile when running so if I decide I want to merge two of my running playlists or add an artist to the playlist I am listening to literally my only viable solution is Mergify.

####Let's see it!

####Colophon:
I made this at HackRU 2014. It was made with NodeJS, web-dev basics (client side javascript, HTML, CSS), and Spotify's API. It is currently hosted with Heroku.
